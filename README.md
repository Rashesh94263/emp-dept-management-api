## Data Models

### EmployeeDto

```json
{
  "employeeId": 3,
  "firstName": "Rashesh",
  "lastName": "Dobariya",
  "email": "rashes.dobariya@example.com",
 
}
```


### DepartmentDto

```json
{
  "departmentId": 1,
  "departmentName": "Computer Science",
   "createdAt": "2023-01-29T10:15:30",
  "updatedAt": "2023-02-29T10:15:30"
 
}
```

### Error Handling 

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 201 CREATED, 404 NOT FOUND) to indicate the outcome of requests. Additionally, it throws custom exceptions like DepartmentNotFoundException and EmployeeNotFoundException with descriptive error messages.


### Authentication and Authorization
